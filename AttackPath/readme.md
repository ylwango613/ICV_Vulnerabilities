# Introduction to Vehicle Network Vulnerability Attack Patterns

This folder introduces the attack vectors for various modules of connected vehicles, based on the attack methods derived from 649 real-world vulnerabilities we have collected. The public release of this information may potentially enable malicious attackers to exploit existing, unpatched vulnerabilities in ICVs, posing a security threat. 
However, it is also crucial for testers to have access to this information in order to more effectively assess the security of unsold ICVs. 
Therefore, we provide a general flowchart but refrain from elaborating on the specific methods.
If you are a tester seeking specific information for security purposes, please feel free to contact us via email.
